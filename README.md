Welcome to Neeka Social! At Neeka, our goal is to create healthier online communities and improve discourse over technological mediums. We believe that in the same way engagement-based algorithms create echo-chambers and divisive content, algorithms designed to promote social-health could help eliminate those things! We think the Neeka Consensus algorithm may be one such example. Please support us as we research solutions to the social media dilemma.

This page will be used to document our research on the Neeka Consensus algorithm. 

If you have any questions, critiques, or suggestions about our research, please feel free to email us at [research@neeka.social](mailto:research@neeka.social)

# What does Neeka mean?

The name Neeka came from an attempt to shorten "anechoic" as in [anechoic chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber) which is the opposite of an echo-chamber. We also intend for it to refer to the Jainism philosophy of [anekantavada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavada), which states that the truth is complex and therefore you should search for it in diverse places.
# How Does the Neeka Algorithm Work?

The Neeka algorithm traverses the graph formed by user interactions on a social network. While doing so, it creates a sort of "DNA" for each user that can be used to represent their interests, views, and stances. User DNA is used to calculate specific statistics about consensuses on content formed by user votes: the diversity of users who like or dislike a piece of content and the polarity between users who like and dislike that content. Consensuses are weighed in favor of ideologically diverse groups and in favor of content that is less divisive.  
# Show me the tests!

We will show two of our tests here. One uses a simulation to test the algorithm and the other uses real-world vote data from Reddit.

We use the same evaluation method in each test. In both tests we assume the existence of two groups of users: GROUP0 and GROUP1. Each group has its own set of beliefs and interests which may are distinct from the other group. Each post is allocated values that represent the post's affinity to each group. Posts can either be liked by both groups, disliked by both groups, liked by one and not the other, and all by varying degrees. 

With the group affinity of each post, we can calculate the theoretical ideal rankings of posts, optimizing for two statistics: agreement between user groups and apolarity. With those ideal rankings established, we calculate a percentage difference between those rankings and the rankings generated by both simple consensus and the Neeka algorithm. 

We also are able to calculate the overall bias toward a user group for each ranking. We use this to calculate the neutrality of both simple consensuses and the Neeka algorithm.

To further demonstrate this algorithm, we will show examples of the posts most-promoted and most-demoted by the Neeka algorithm as it runs on the real-world Reddit data.
## Simulation

In this simulation, we generate 18535 synthetic posts and 17004 synthetic users, with each user making an average of 59 posts. There is a strong imbalance between the two groups of users, with GROUP0 composing about 70% of the user base and GROUP1 composing only about 30%. Here are the results:

```
    simple_agreement: 76.63 %
    neeka_agreement: 89.24 %

    simple_apolar: 33.27 %
    neeka_apolar: 45.04 %

    simple_neutrality: 66.0 %
    neeka_neutrality: 99.28 %
```

Here we see that the Neeka algorithm improves upon simple consensus significantly across all three statistics. We see a 12.61% improvement in the promotion of posts that the two groups agree upon and an 11.78% improvement in apolarity. We also see a 33.28% improvement in neutrality of the ranking, bringing Neeka's neutrality extremely close to the ideal for that statistic.

Although we are only showing this one simulation as an example, these results are typical for simulations with the specified parameters. 
## Real-World Data

For this test, we narrow the scope of our test to the large political subreddits [/r/politics](#), [/r/news](#), and [/r/worldnews](#). 

Admittedly, we don't have "ground-truth" for the affinity values of each post or the membership of users in any ideological groups. It is not ideal, but we use the user DNA the Neeka algorithm generates along with the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to attempt to cluster users into two groups. Knowing what groups users are likely a part of, we are able to calculate the "affinity" values for each post based on their votes. Although this is not ideal, it allows us to use the same metrics that we used in the simulation and hopefully this will give us some indication of the algorithm's efficacy on real-world data. However, "the proof is in the pudding" and we will also provide several samples showing exactly what posts the Neeka algorithm most promotes and most demotes over simple consensus so you can judge for yourself.

In this test, there are 18384 posts and 27647 users. HDBSCAN clustered 11491 of those users into GROUP0 and 6699 users into GROUP1. 3457 users could not be clustered into either group and their votes will be ignored for the purpose of this test.

Here are the results:

```
	  simple_agreement: 29.86 %
    neeka_agreement: 52.67 %

    simple_apolar: 24.19 %
    neeka_apolar: 49.67 %

    simple_neutrality: 72.46 %
    neeka_neutrality: 85.21 %
```

Here we see that the Neeka algorithm again significantly improved upon simple consensus  across all three statistics. The Neeka algorithms improved group agreement by 22.81%, apoloarity by 25.49%, and neutrality by 12.76%. 
### The Pudding

"The proof is in the pudding". Below you can judge for yourself how well the Neeka algorithm achieves its goals. To be honest, it seems to be a mixed bag, but you may notice some consistencies in the type of content Neeka buries.
